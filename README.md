Making hospitals slightly more bearable

## The Problem
- Ever waited for hours in an hospital for seemingly no reason at all?
- Wouldn't it be amazing if you could just know how long you need to wait exactly so that you could go and get a cup of tea, or coffee or what have you.

We ([Damodar](github.com/DamodarNayak9398), [Yash](github.com/yashyrs) and I ) were moved by this problem and had to do something about it so we built a prototype in the GE Healthcare Hackathon 2019.

## The Solution
- A webapp that predicts the amount of time you need to wait for your appointment.
- Use the data collected to generate useful analytics.
